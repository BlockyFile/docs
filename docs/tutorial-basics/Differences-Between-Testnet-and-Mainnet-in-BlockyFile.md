# Differences Between Testnet and Mainnet in BlockyFile

In BlockyFile, there are significant differences between the testnet and mainnet environments. This section will explain these differences in detail.

## Testnet

### Mining Difficulty
The mining difficulty in the testnet is significantly lower compared to the mainnet. This makes it easier to mine new blocks and obtain rewards.

### Faucet for BFY Coin
In the testnet, there is a faucet that provides free BFY tokens to anyone who requests them. This allows users to acquire BFY tokens without the need for mining.

### Purpose
The testnet is primarily used for testing the BlockyFile network and file uploading functionality. It allows users to experiment, identify issues, and provide feedback.

### Limited Lifespan
The testnet has a limited lifespan. Typically, it exists for about 2 months. After this period, if there are no major issues or problems, the testnet will be discontinued and replaced by the mainnet.

## Mainnet

### Mining for BFY Coin
In the mainnet, the only way to obtain BFY tokens is through mining. Users need to contribute computational power to validate transactions and secure the network in order to earn BFY tokens.

### Production Environment
The mainnet is the live production environment of BlockyFile. It represents the real network where file uploads, transactions, and other operations are permanent and have real value.

### Long-Term Persistence
Unlike the testnet, the mainnet is designed to persist indefinitely. It forms the backbone of the BlockyFile ecosystem and is used for real-world blockchain.

It's important to note that while the testnet provides a sandbox environment for testing and experimentation, the mainnet is where the actual use and value of BlockyFile are realized.

For more information and updates on the transition from the testnet to the mainnet, please refer to the official BlockyFile documentation.
