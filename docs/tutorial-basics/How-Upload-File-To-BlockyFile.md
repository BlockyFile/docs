# Uploading Files with BlockyFile

This guide will walk you through the steps to download and use the BlockyFile program for uploading files to the blockchain. Please follow the instructions carefully:

## 1. Configuration

1. Download the BlockyFile program from the [official github's download page](https://github.com/BlockyFile/BFY-Data-Uploader/releases).
2. Open the `.env` file using a text editor.
3. Enter your public and private keys in their respective fields in the following format:

PUBLIC_KEY = "your_public_key"

PRIVATE_KEY = "your_private_key"

Make sure to keep the quotes around the keys and not share them with anyone.

## 2. Running the Program

1. Run the executable file `blockyfile.exe` on your operating system.
2. The BlockyFile application will open, and you will be ready to upload your file to the blockchain.

## 3. File Upload

1. Select the file you want to upload using the "Browse" or "Select file" button in the BlockyFile application. It is recommended to use files below 20 MB for a better experience.
2. Choose the desired encoding option between "Base64" or "Base64 + Password". The "Base64 + Password" option will protect the file so that only those with the password can read it on the blockchain.
3. Click the "Upload" button to initiate the file upload process to the blockchain.

## 4. Receiving the Contract

1. Once the file upload is completed, you will receive a unique contract identification (hash) generated on the blockchain.
2. This hash can be used to access the contract and retrieve the file at a later time.

By following these simple steps, you will be able to use BlockyFile to upload files to the blockchain and securely store them. Make sure to keep your private key safe and perform regular backups of your uploaded files.

For more information and resources, please refer to the complete BlockyFile documentation on the official website.

Happy file uploading with BlockyFile!
